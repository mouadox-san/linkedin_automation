    "content": "Innovations in MRI technology have led to the development of faster acquisition sequences, which research indicates could reduce scan times by up to 50% without compromising image quality. These advancements are particularly beneficial for patients who have difficulty remaining still during scans, such as pediatric or claustrophobic patients. Faster sequences also increase scanner throughput, allowing radiology departments to serve more patients efficiently while maintaining high diagnostic standards.",
